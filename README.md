# ⚠️ Archived — Superseded by agent-memory-core

This repository was an early prototype of the persistent vector memory system.

**It has been superseded by [agent-memory-core](https://github.com/JakebotLabs/agent-memory-core)**, which provides a production-ready, properly packaged implementation with:

- Three-layer architecture (Markdown + ChromaDB/Vector + NetworkX/Graph)
- Significance classification
- Automated maintenance
- Full test suite
- Clean `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml` packaging

## Do not use this repo for new work. Use [agent-memory-core](https://github.com/JakebotLabs/agent-memory-core) instead.
